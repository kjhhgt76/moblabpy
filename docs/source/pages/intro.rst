What is Moblabpy
================

Moblabpy is a software toolbox designed to emulate the working of a communication channel and enable the 
conducting of communication related experiments in associated courses, System View of Communications: 
from Signals to Packets or Error Control Coding and Information Theory. Moblabpy gives users the ability 
to do experiments without dedicated hardware and software license, but with their laptop (or desktop) 
computers and mobile phones anywhere at any time. This toolbox is built upon Python as a module package. 
Python 3.9 and the Moblabpy module are required on the computer. “IP Camera Lite” for iPhones and iOS 
devices, or “IP Camera” for Android devices are also required (Both developed by ShenYao). Moblabpy acts 
as a control panel of a visible light communication system. The computer display acts as a transmitter 
and the phone camera as a receiver. Users can experiment the effect of noise and error correcting
codes have in communication.
